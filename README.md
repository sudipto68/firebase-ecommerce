This is a Demo E-commerce Web App. To show main functionality of an Ecommerce Project. For the database part I have used Firebase database to host the product's data.

Till now:

1. User can filter product
2. Search Products
3. Add product to cart and in cart page increment and decrements products

I have not implemented any authentication for this project yet. I have used React Redux for the state management purpose.

## Used Technology:

1. React Js
2. Bootstrap
3. React Router (v6)
4. Redux - for state management
5. Firebase - for database

### This project is not completed yet. These things I will add:

1. User Authentication (using firebase google sign in)
2. Design the pages to look more clean and nice.
3. More pages
4. Separe perfectly ui code and business logic

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
