This is a Demo E-commerce Web App. For the database part I have used Firebase database to host the product's data.

I have not implemented any authentication for this project yet. I have used React Redux for the state management purpose.

## Used Technology:

1. React Js
2. Bootstrap
3. React Router (v6)
4. Redux - for state management
5. Firebase - for datbase

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
